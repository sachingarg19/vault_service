WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

PowerShell:
    $env:VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cmd.exe:
    set VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: xDVPnkaUihNrUKde8HC2pcB7bCgz9eDMm6Z8cF3g5uE=
Root Token: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

                 Version: Vault v1.4.2

WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

PowerShell:
    $env:VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cmd.exe:
    set VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: NMbsGYVepbTlhTns07J+nFH2F55CA//ZfLZldpWGAsU=
Root Token: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
